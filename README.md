OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJET:EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)
The objective of this EDA project is to explore and understand the Iris dataset by examining feature distributions, relationships, and correlations. It aims to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers while visualizing these insights through various plots. This process helps in making informed decisions for feature selection and data cleaning, ultimately preparing the dataset for further analysis or modeling.
KEY ACTIVITIES
1. **Inspect Data**: Review dataset structure and basic statistics.
2. **Visualize**: Plot histograms, pair plots, and scatter plots.
3. **Analyze Correlations**: Compute and visualize feature correlations.
4. **Identify Outliers**: Detect anomalies and unusual data points.
TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
3. **numpy**: Library for numerical operations and calculations.
4. **matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
5. **seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib.
KEY INSIGHTS
1. **Distinct Species**: Sepal and petal sizes separate Iris species clearly.
2. **High Correlation**: Petal length and width are strongly correlated.
3. **Feature Variability**: Petal dimensions show greater variability than sepal dimensions.
4. **Potential Outliers**: Some data points deviate from general patterns.
